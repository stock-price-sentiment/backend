# APIs

## 2️⃣ Authentication API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

    *  DB_PWD - the password for the database user
    *  DB_URL - the URI route for the database, can be local or remote.
    *  DB_NAME - the name of the database sql alchemy will use to make DML actions.
    * DATABASE_URL - set this if you have a remove database you would like to connect to, overwrites all other database environment variables.

### testing tools and description

- nose2 - used to implement unit-tests for the models, controllers, and services in a decoupled state.
- coverage - for generating coverage reports.

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

_instructions to set up a local dev environment, be sure to have docker and docker-compose installed and ready to go._

- docker-compose build - builds the dockerfile and the database.
- docker-compose up - launches both containers and links them within a local network.
- docker-compose down - removes both containers and any persistent volumes on your hard drive.

### <p><span style="color:red">If you do not have docker and docker compose installed then you must use the alternative commands below.</span></p>

```
* virtualenv <env name> - (optional) create a virtual environment for installing all packages that pertain to this app.
* source <env name>/bin/activate - (optional) activate the virtual environment.
* pip install -r requirements.txt - install all python packages which are in the requirements file.
